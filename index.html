            <h3>Computer Science major with a Photography minor </h3>
            <p>My name is Teddy Bien-Aime, a college freshman freelance photographer at Morehouse College in Atlanta, GA. I picked a camera for the first time when I was a 6th grader in Port-au-Prince, Haiti and was fascinated by the amount of things that were possible with the device. Unfortunately I had to stop due to not having my own device and grades but didn't give up and started taking pictures with my phone. I started using my own camera as a first year in college and said that I had to create a name if I wanted to continue on my journey of photography. One morning while I was thinking of names for my photography business I knew that I was going to use my initials "TB" in it somewhere and that's when my dorm-mates told me to add visuals after and this is how TB Visuals came to reality. </p>
